## COAL VERTICAL ROLLER MILL ZK Ball Mill Cement Mill Rotary.
Vertical roller mill can replace ball mills or tube mills used for preparing coal.Today VRMs with capacities up to 50 tph are the dominant technology for coal grinding.Grinding media wear in a VRM will only be 5 to 10 g ton of coal powder,as compared to 100 g ton of coal powder in a ball mill.Application:Simulation for the Design of Ball Mills for Coal Grinding.The extension of the model to air swept coal mills described by Austin et al.was used to simulate results from a 2.75 m diameter by 3.51 m air swept ball mill and it also gave good agreement with actual plant data,for product size distribution and capacity in tph.
