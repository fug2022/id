## Iron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace steel
blast furnace process.The iron ore concentrate is now mixed and ready for the pelletizing process.Pelletizing A pellet plant contains a series of balling drums where the iron ore concentrate is formed into soft pellets,in much the same manner that one rolls a snowball,to make a pellet about the size of a marble (between 1 4" and 1 2").Pelletizing WikipediaIron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6 16 mm (0.24 0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces.They typically contain 64% 72% Fe and various additional material adjusting the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets.Typically limestone,dolomite and olivine is added and Bentonite is used as binder.The process of pelletizing combines mixing of.
