## Crushing for particle shape AggMan
Nov 17,2014 · Impact crushers are the first crusher types that come to mind for rock on rock crushing,whether they are horizontal shaft impact crushers (HSIs) or vertical shaft impact crushers (VSIs).Modern,high speed cone crushers using a fine cone liner configuration also will provide some rock on rock crushing,as long as they are kept choke fed.Cone Crushers Mineral Processing & MetallurgyCone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.
