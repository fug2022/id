## Gold Leaching from Refractory Ores—Literature Survey.
Apr 27,2007 · This review is essentially an overview of the pretreatment processes for the refractory gold ores available in the recent literature.When gold is finely disseminated in sulphides,arsenosulphides,tellurides,carbonaceous and clayey materials direct alkaline cyanidation is not effective for gold extraction.However,pretreatment processes involving thermal oxidation,such as roasting.pretreatment of refractory sulphide gold ores and concentratesrefractory gold ore and pretreatment mining equipment.Refractory gold ore pretreatment Treatment of refractory gold ore (whole ore and flotation concentrates) has become more prominent since the 1980s with many gold discoveries often including ores that are wholly or partially refractory.
