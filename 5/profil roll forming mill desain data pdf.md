## ROLL PASS DESIGN EVAULUATION USING SOFTWARE.
OBJECTIVE OF ROLL PASS DESIGN Steel sections are generally rolled in several passes,whose num ber is determined by the ratio of initial input material and final cros s section of finished product.The cross section area is reduced in each pass and form and size of the stock gradually approach to the desired profile.Rolling (metalworking) WikipediaHot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material.After the grains deform during processing,they recrystallize,which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening.The starting material is usually large pieces of metal,like semi finished casting products,such as slabs,blooms,and billets.
