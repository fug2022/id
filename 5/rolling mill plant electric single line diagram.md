## The Hot Rolling Process California Steel Industries
The Hot Rolling Process The primary function of the Hot Strip Mill is to reheat semi finished steel slabs of steel nearly to their melting point,then roll them thinner and longer through 12 successive rolling mill stands driven by motors totaling 77,000 hp,and finally coiling up the lengthened steel sheet for transport to the next process.Buildings that makes up a steel mill Model Railroader.That may be,but your question was: what buildings make up a steel mill.Walthers produced the blast furnace,coke plant,rolling mill and electric furnace in N scale.I have the buildings for a completely interated steel mill.Correct me if I am wrong,but here are the steel mill production line is this:
