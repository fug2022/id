## Uranium Recovery from Phosphates
Apr 15,2019 · A more cautious figure of up to 3700 t U a for the theoretically possible uranium recovery from phosphates is presented in [IAEA 2001].This total assumes annual production of phosphate rock of 142 million tonnes per year yielding 66 million tonnes of concentrate.Phosphate Rock an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe next step in the phosphate fertiliser production chain is the chemical treatment,which may contaminate the environment in the vicinity of the plant (Kucera et al.2007; othman and Al Masri,2007).Wet process sulfuric acid acidulation is the most common technique for treating phosphate rock.
