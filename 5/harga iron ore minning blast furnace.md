## Creating Iron HowStuffWorks
­The more advanced way to smelt iron is in a blast furnace.A blast furnace is charged with iron ore,charcoal or coke (coke is charcoal made from coal) and limestone (CaCO 3 ­).Huge quantities of air blast in at the bottom of the furnace,and the calcium in the limestone combines with the silicates to form slag.Krakatau Steel: Prospek Blast Furnace Indonesia Value.Perbedaan lainnya,blast furnace tidak membutuhkan iron ore pellet (bijih besi berbentuk butir pasir agak kasar) dalam membuat besi,melainkan cukup membutuhkan bijih besi saja.Sementara dalam membuat baja mentah,blast furnace tidak membutuhkan steel scrap (kepingan kepingan baja tua) seperti jika menggunakan teknik EAF,melainkan hanya.

## Iron Production Chemistry LibreTexts
The production of iron from its ore involves an oxidation reduction reaction carried out in a blast furnace.Iron ore is usually a mixture of iron and vast quantities of impurities such as sand and clay referred to as gangue.The iron found in iron ores are found in the form of iron oxides.A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel.In addition to mined iron ore,other sources of iron,such as flue dust collected from blast furnaces,or the dust produced at mine sites,is also frequently pelletized so it can be utilized,as opposed to disposed of.The Pelletizing Process.The production of iron ore pellets from fines to finished product can differ based on a variety of.

## Iron Mine and Blast Furnace Goldfields Guide
In the mid 1870s,the Lal Lal Iron Company installed mining machinery,erected a large blast furnace and constructed a tramway to convey ore from the mine.For a brief time in the early 1880s,the Lal Lal Company had over 100 men engaged in mining and smelting the iron ore,gathering limestone (flux) and firewood,and manufacturing charcoal.Mineral Resource of the Month: Iron and Steel Slag EARTH.Iron and steel slag,also known as ferrous slag,is produced by adding limestone (or dolomite),lime and silica sand to blast furnaces and steel furnaces to strip impurities from iron ore,scrap and other ferrous feed materials and to lower the heat requirements of the iron and steelmaking processes.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.Electric Smelting Furnace of OreCharcoal blast furnaces were used for many years to reduce the iron ore,but since 1910 the metallurgists have persevered with the electric furnace,according to Christiansen.After many trials with a 6,000 kv. a furnace in 1925 and one of 9,000 kv a in 1927.
