## Screw conveyor Wikipedia
A screw conveyor or auger conveyor is a mechanism that uses a rotating helical screw blade,called a "flighting",usually within a tube,to move liquid or granular materials.They are used in many bulk handling industries.Screw conveyors in modern industry are often used horizontally or at a slight incline as an efficient way to move semi solid materials,including food waste,wood chips.Flexible Screw Conveyors Spiroflowmaximum working life.Easy to clean The simplicity of the Spirolow.equipment which is usually integrated with our lexible screw conveyors.Mobile conveyors For added versatility,mobile conveyors are available.and elevation of conveyor.We recommend material testing to determine correct model.

## Inclined Screw Conveyor Calculation EngineeringClicks
Jul 14,2014 · Based on MY interpretation of what my little slide rule indicates that if you're moving 10,000 lbs of portland cement per hour in an 20 inch diameter screw that is 45% (max recommended) loaded,the screw speed should be about 100 RPM.If the conveyor is 100 feet long the HP required is about 1.4 HP to move the material.Used Industrial Conveyor Systems For Sale SPIScrew conveyors use a tube or trough with a helix screw to move bulk materials.Pneumatic conveyors use air pressure to move bulk materials through tubes.Inclined conveyors are belt conveyors with an incline to move material to a different elevation.Vertical conveyors move materials vertically and have many different types.
