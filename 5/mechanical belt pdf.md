## Belt drive mechanics Britannica
Belt drive,in machinery,a pair of pulleys attached to usually parallel shafts and connected by an encircling flexible belt (band) that can serve to transmit and modify rotary motion from one shaft to the other.Most belt drives consist of flat leather,rubber,or fabric belts running on.Belt (mechanical) WikipediaHistory.The mechanical belt drive,using a pulley machine,was first mentioned in the text the Dictionary of Local Expressions by the Han Dynasty philosopher,poet,and politician Yang Xiong (53 18 BC) in 15 BC,used for a quilling machine that wound silk fibers on to bobbins for weavers' shuttles.The belt drive is an essential component to the invention of the spinning wheel.

Available energy power is required to be transmitted to get desired motion and work.When the power is transmitted from input to output using mechanical elements is known as mechanical power transmission.Mechanical elements like friction disc,various type of belts,rope,chain,gears,couplings etc.are used for power transmission.Adjusting Mechanical Take Ups on Belt ConveyorsAdjusting Mechanical Take Ups on Belt Conveyors.Douglas Manufacturing Co.Inc.strongly recommends that any safety program be supplemented by the use of ASME B20.1 2009 that refers to conveyor systems.Never operate,adjust or install equipment on a moving conveyor.Always follow lock out and tag out procedures when working on

joined belts,Figure 2,which consist of two or more belts held together with a high strength band that prevents the belts from bending sideways and keeps them running straight into the pulley grooves even under severe pulsating or shock loads.A wider synchronous belt can increase lateral rigidity,but should be tensioned carefully.
