## Simulation for the Design of Ball Mills for Coal Grinding.
The extension of the model to air swept coal mills described by Austin et al.was used to simulate results from a 2.75 m diameter by 3.51 m air swept ball mill and it also gave good agreement with actual plant data,for product size distribution and capacity in tph.Vertical Roller Mills FLSmidthWhen it comes to grinding raw coal,savings in specific energy consumption can be achieved with vertical roller mills.Specific energy consumption depends on the grindability of the raw coal and the coal meal fineness required.A dynamic separator that ensures high separation efficiency also helps to reduce specific energy use.

## Coal Preparation an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Dilip Kumar,Deepak Kumar,in Sustainable Management of Coal Preparation,2018.3.1 Preamble.A coal preparation plant should be considered as a system where raw coal is the input and washed products are the output.A system is defined as the integration of components which interact in a specific manner to accomplish a common goal or objective.Pulverizer WikipediaSimilar to the ring and ball mill,the vertical spindle roller mill uses large "tires" to crush the coal.These mills are usually found in utility plants.Raw coal is gravity fed through a central feed pipe to the grinding table where it flows outwardly by centrifugal action and is ground between the rollers and table.
