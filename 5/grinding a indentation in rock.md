## Hardness,Toughness,and Brittleness: An Indentation.
The ratio H K c,wjere His hardness (resistance to deformation) and K c.is toughness (resistance to fracture),is proposed as an index of brittleness.Indentation mechanics provides the scientific basis for this proposal.The analysis,developed in terms of a model contact system,indicates that all materials are more susceptible to deformation in small‐scale loading events and to fracture.Mechanisms of rock cutting Mechanics DrillingBits and coreheads cut rock by crushing,shearing,grinding or jetting.Crushing bits are the well known roller cone bits and hammer bits.1 Crushing bits roller cone rock bits.Crushing bits work by crushing the rock to make an indentation with a tooth and then scouring the rock.

## Rock properties oocities
a) Rock Hardness.Rock hardness is a term used in geology to denote the cohesiveness of a rock and is usually expressed as its compressive fracture strength.Terms such as hardrock and softrock are used by geologists to distinguishing between igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks,respectively.Native Americans:Prehistoric:Archaic:Archaeological SitesModoc Rock Shelter is a small indentation at the bottom of a rock cliff at the edge of the Mississippi River valley.The indentation is large enough for many people to find shelter from precipitation and wind.Over thousands of years,Native Americans lived periodically beneath the rock ceiling at Modoc Rock.

## How to Identify an Indian Tool Made From Rock Our Pastimes
How to Identify an Indian Tool Made From Rock By Victoria Ries ; Updated April 12,2017.Identifying Indian tools made from rock is moderately easy if you know what you're looking for.Indian artifacts may be strewn where there was once a settlement.Arrowheads and bird points may be found at vantage points,such as cliff tops and bluffs.erosion National Geographic SocietyErosion is the process where rocks are broken down by natural forces such as wind or water.There are two main types of erosion: chemical and physical.Chemical erosion occurs when a rock's chemical composition changes,such as when iron rusts or when limestone dissolves due to carbonation.
