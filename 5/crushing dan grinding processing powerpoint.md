## Mineral processing Wikipedia
The primarily used equipment in crushing are jaw crushers,gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills,closed circuited with a classifier unit,are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant.Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed wet and hence is more energy.Mineral Comminution and Separation Systemsdynamics.Major process operations are largely related to particulate technology and consist of size reduction (or comminution) by crushing and grinding for the liberation of minerals,separation of mineral particles by va rious principles and a number of operations associated with them.However,most of the processes are basically physical (or

## Crushing Mineral Processing
In mineral processing,the reduction of minerals by crushing and grinding may be regarded as having one or other of two main objectives: the attainment of a size appropriate for the direct industrial application of the mineral,e.g.barytes,sand,aggregate; or the release of metallic or ore inclusions from an unwanted matrix with a view to.Mineral processing metallurgy BritannicaMineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.
