## Design of a Hoisting System for a Small Scale Mine.
The hoisting system is essential for the transportation of equipment,personnel,mined ore and thus for the productivity of the mine.It consists of various components in which there are winders,ropes and electric motors.The safety and reliability of the hoist depends on its design,therefore proper and accurate design of a hoist is essential.Hoist (mining) WikipediaIn underground mining a hoist or winder is used to raise and lower conveyances within the mine shaft.Modern hoists are normally powered using electric motors,historically with direct current drives utilizing Ward Leonard control machines and later solid state converters (),however modern large hoists use alternating current drives that are variable frequency controlled.
