## Corrosionpedia What is Sintering? Definition from.
Sintering is a heat treatment process in which a large quantity of loose aggregate material is subjected to a sufficiently high temperature and pressure to cause the loose material to become a compact solid piece.The amount of heat and pressure administered during the sintering process is slightly less than the material's melting point.manganese ore sintering processTraveling Grate Sinter Plant;.This process,primarily used for iron ores,can also be used for sintering manganese and nickel ore fines.Get Price And Support Online; manganese sintering process design fervisagie.nl.sintering plant for manganese cagindiain KMR also plans to build a sintering plant,which will process manganese ore into a.
