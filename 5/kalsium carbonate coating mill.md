## Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) Minerals.
Precipitated Calcium Carbonate.PCC stands for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate—also known as purified,refined or synthetic calcium carbonate.It has the same chemical formula as other types of calcium carbonate,such as limestone,marble and chalk: CaCO3.The calcium,carbon and oxygen atoms can arrange themselves in three different ways,to form three different calcium carbonate.Calcium Carbonate omyaCalcium carbonate is an exceptional compound.The chemical formula CaCO 3 represents a raw material that exists everywhere in nature whether dissolved in rivers and oceans,melted as "cold" carbonatite lava and solidified as a mineral,dripstone or as a parent material for whole mountain ranges.Plants and animals need calcium carbonate to form their skeletons and shells,and even modern.
