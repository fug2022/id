## Ball mill slaker Bulk Chemical Storage Systems
Horizontal ball mill slakers typically operate between 75 o C and 85 o C.Because the temperature is not measured in the slaking zone it is difficult to maximize the operating temperature to minimize chemical consumption.An alternate version of the horizontal ball mill slaker is vertical ball mill slaker which is a vertical stirred ball mill.Fine milling of chromite sand in a 5 litre stirred ball millA 5 litre vertical batch stirred ball mill was used to study comminution characteristics.Chromite sand was used as the feed.A factorial design was prepared with the following parameters,which influence grinding in a stirred ball mill: pulp density,pin tip velocity,ball density,and size.
