## 8 Aluminum Oxide Grinding Wheels Products & Suppliers.
Description: Weiler TIGER grinding wheel uses aluminum oxide as the abrasive material and has a diameter of 7 in.Weiler incorporates this aluminum oxide material into the grinding wheel forming a grit of 24.In addition to the other aspects of these parts,Abrasive Grain Type: Aluminum OxideGrinding of TZP Al2O3 Composite with Vitrified CBN WheelsGrinding of the promising composite ceramics of TZP Al2O3 with vitrified bond CBN grinding wheels was investigated in this paper.The results showed that higher material removal rates and satisfactory surface finish were achieved,CBN wheels with coarser grit size or with higher CBN concentration had higher grinding ratio.
