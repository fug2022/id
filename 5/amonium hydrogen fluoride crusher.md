## Ammonium fluoride Wikipedia
On passing hydrogen fluoride gas (in excess) through the salt,ammonium fluoride absorbs the gas to form the addition compound ammonium bifluoride.The reaction occurring is: NH 4 F + HF → NH 4 HF 2.It sublimes when heated—a property common among ammonium salts.In the sublimation,the salt decomposes to ammonia and hydrogen fluoride,and the two gases can recombine to give ammonium.HYDROGEN FLUORIDE HYDROFLUORIC ACIDAPPEARANCE: Hydrogen fluoride is a colorless fuming liquid below 67°F (19.4°C),or a colorless gas.When hydrogen fluoride is combined with water it is known as hydrofluoric acid,a colorless liquid,which in low concentrations is visually indistinguishable from water.
