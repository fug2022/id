Silica.Also called silica sand or quartz sand,silica is silicon dioxide (SiO 2).Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth’s crust.Since sand is plentiful,easy to mine and relatively easy to process,it is the primary ore source of silicon.The metamorphic rock,quartzite,is another source.What Is a Mineral Glass Crystal? LEAFtvMineral glass gets hardened by a tempering process and is more likely to break than plexiglass.Although this is the case,mineral glass remains more scratch resistant than plexiglass.Mineral glass crystals are coated in a hard material which makes them less likely to be scratched.
