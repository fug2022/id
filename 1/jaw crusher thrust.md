## Crusher Bearings: Knowing the basics leads to better care
Mar 03,2016 · Jaw crushers.Most operations prefer jaw crushers for primary crushing.A large feed opening allows these crushers to receive larger sized material than most other types of machines.Bearing speeds and loads are generally moderate,but,on occasion,the load spikes as uncrushable material passes through the chamber.Jaw Crushers McLanahanJaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber.For example,a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies.The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.
