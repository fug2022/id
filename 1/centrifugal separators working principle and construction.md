## Filtration Principle of Centrifugal Filter Filmedia Home
When the dirty liquid to be purified enters the high speed rotating separator,the solid particles are trapped in the wall of the separator due to the centrifugal force,and the clean liquid flows out from the upper side of the separator.Centrifugal filter is mainly used for the primary filtration of sediment flow,separable sand and stones.Anderson® Centrifugal Separators : FiltrationThe Anderson Hi eF™ Centrifugal Separators operate on a patented two stage principle of separation that employs carefully controlled flow guiding the entrainment laden vapor through a series of vanes and baffles.Each component of the separating element is designed to obtain maximum separating efficiency.

## Centrifuge Wikipedia
A centrifuge is a piece of equipment that puts an object in rotation around a fixed axis (spins it in a circle),applying a force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward) that can be very strong.The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle,where the centrifugal acceleration causes denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction.Cyclonic separation WikipediaA cyclonic separation is a method of removing particulates from an air,gas or liquid stream,without the use of filters,through vortex separation.When removing particulate matter from liquid,a hydrocyclone is used; while from gas,a gas cyclone is used.Rotational effects and gravity are used to separate mixtures of solids and fluids.The method can also be used to separate fine droplets.
