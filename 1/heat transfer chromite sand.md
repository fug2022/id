(1) Powder bulk density: As CERABEADS ® artificial sand is about half as light as zircon and chromite,it can turn out about twice the number of molds per unit weight.It can also be handled very easily,saving labor and transfer power costs.However,attention should be given to the amount of binder addition.CHILLSThis is done by a high specific heat and high heat conductibility.The chill can be made of all types of materials,which must have a higher specific heat and or conductibility as the moulding material.This can be special sand as is chromite sand,zircon sand.Or metal,as is grey or vermicular or ductile iron as in special cases copper.

## Development to Proceed on Oregon Source for Chromite Sand.
Chromite is used in the production of high quality alloy steel castings,and backers of the new project say it has "improved heat transfer characteristics" that "can modify and improve the surface characteristics of specialty steel or iron alloys."Analysis of solidification in sand and permanent mold.The mold material was chromite sand.The computation conditions are listed in Table 1.The thermal properties for steel and chromite sand used in the simulation are given in Tables 2 and 3,respectively.An effective heat transfer coefficient was assumed to be 100 Btu ft2 h throughout the casting sand.

## Chromite Sand Spinel for the foundry industry LKAB.
Chromite Sand is a naturally occurring spinel consisting primarily of the oxides of chrome and iron.It is a by product of ferro chrome production and is mainly used in foundry applications and in glass production.Chromite Buy Foundry Chromite Sand Product onPremium clean chromite sand,ideal for foundry applications.This combination results in a higher heat transfer rate,improved core and mold strengths,and the potential for lower binder addition,which in turn produces less binder emissions and smoke.Oregon Resources Corporation is the only producer of chromite in the United States.
