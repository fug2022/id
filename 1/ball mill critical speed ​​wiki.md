## Ball Mills an overview ScienceDirect Topics
For ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just below this speed (70 80%).critical speed of ball mill from wikiBall mill Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia.A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing.The grinding works on the principle of critical speed.
