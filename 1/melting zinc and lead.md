## Ladles Dippers RotoMetals
Warning These are for ladling out of a pot for metals under 1000 F.Do not try to melt metals in these ladles as they will flake and holes will form.The furnaces that we supply are not for use with Zinc Based Pewter as the zinc will corrode the steel of the pot.Our tin based pewters are safe for use in these pots.Zinc (Zn) The Foundry ZoneZinc is a fair conductor of electricity.For a metal,zinc has relatively low melting and boiling points Its melting point is the lowest of all the *transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium.As a dense,inexpensive,easily worked material,zinc is used as a lead replacement.

The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure; at the melting point,the solid and liquid phases exist in equilibrium.A substance's melting point depends on pressure and is usually specified at standard pressure in reference materials.

## Zinc smelting Wikipedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals,zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost,unless specific.
