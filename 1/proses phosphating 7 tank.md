## Zinc Plating Process
A standard 7 tank DIP ZINC PHOSPHATING process is used,where good paint adhesion and corrosion resistance are required before painting.However,where hot rolled sheet metal or heavily rusty surfaces are to be dealt with,the use of mineral acids like hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid will have to be used.Tube Drawing Zinc Phosphate Coating Iron PhosphatingTUBE DRAWING ZINC PHOSPHATE LINE : 1.Alkaline Degreaser.temperature : 70 90 ° C.treatment time : 5 10 min.
