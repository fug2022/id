## What is the hardness of iron Answers
The iron ore would be a rock composed of multiple minerals,each with their own hardness on the Mohs hardness scale.There are multiple ores of iron.In brinell scale,the hardness value is 180ELI5:How exactly does iron beat bronze? : explainlikeimfiveThe big thing for warfare was that iron carries along with it steel.Iron is a bit stronger than bronze,and steel was even moreso.It meant that weapons and armor could be made lighter and more durable.Thus improving both the mobility and endurance of an iron based army over a bronze based one.

## Brinell (Hardness) SN Cast Iron
Brinell hardness is sometimes quoted in megapascals,the Brinell hardness number is multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity,9.81 m s 2,to convert it to megapascals.The BHN can be converted into theultimate tensile strength (UTS),although the relationship is dependent on the material,and therefore determined empirically.Wrought Iron Properties,Applications AZoMAug 13,2013 · Mechanical Properties Applications.Introduction.Wrought iron is an iron alloy with very low carbon content with respect to cast iron.It is soft,ductile,magnetic,and has high elasticity and tensile strength.It can be heated and reheated and worked into various shapes.
