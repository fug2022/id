Iron ore fines The IMSBC Code definition for iron ore refers to cargo in the size range of up to 250mm,and iron ore fines 10% or more of fine particles of less than 1mm and 50% or more of particles less than 10mm.Moisture contents quoted for iron ore fines typically vary between 6 12%,with iron to ore having lower moisture content.The Making of Iron & Steel SEAISIIron ore,as mined,is a combination of iron with oxygen and various other unwanted substances,generally known as "gangue".The first metallurgical step is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron,a process which is mostly carried out in a blast furnace,using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent.
