## Indian Minerals Yearbook 2016 IBM
Phosphate rock is also the source of by product fluorine.Apatite & rock phosphate containing 3 to 4% CaF 2 are useful for recovery of fluorite.Hydrofluoro silicic acid is recovered a s by product from phosphoric acid plants during processing of rock phosphate.Phosphate rocks are also considered as a significant and secondary resource of uranium.Phosphate Rock Mosaic Crop NutritionPhosphate rock comes from geologic deposits located around the world.Its main constituent is apatite,a calcium phosphate mineral primarily extracted from sedimentary marine deposits,with a small amount obtained from igneous sources.Most phosphate rock is recovered through surface mining,although some is extracted from underground mines.

## Apatite Definition of Apatite by Merriam Webster
Apatite definition is any of a group of calcium phosphate minerals occurring in various colors as hexagonal crystals,as granular masses,or in fine grained masses as the chief constituent of phosphate rock and of bones and teeth; especially : calcium phosphate fluoride.Which Minerals Include Phosphate?Apatite is a family of minerals centered around fluorapatite,or calcium phosphate with a bit of fluorine,with the formula Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F.Other members of the apatite group have chlorine or hydroxyl that take the place of the fluorine; silicon,arsenic or vanadium replace the phosphorus (and carbonate replace the phosphate group); and strontium,lead,and other elements substitute for the.
