Rolling and drawing of a metal reduces its thickness but increases its hardness.What is the purpose of rolling of metal? In standard mill practice,the reduction by rolling is figured on the basis of thickness,only because the metal does not widen very much during the rolling operation.Alloy Cast Steel Rolls Mill Rolls ManufacturerAlloy Cast Steel Rolls.Carbon contents of Alloyed Cast Steel range between 0.4 to 1.4 % depending of the hardness level.Additions of Cr,Ni,Mo and other alloying elements and the right heat treatment will develop a pearlitic or sorbitic structure.
