## Bioleaching Wikipedia
Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper,zinc,lead,arsenic,antimony,nickel,molybdenum,gold,silver,and cobaltCyanide Leaching Mining SGSCyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years.During the cyanide leach process,a cyanide solution,or lixiviant,is percolated through ore contained in vats,columns or heaps.Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.
