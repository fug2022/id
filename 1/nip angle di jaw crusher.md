## The Introduction to the Wearing Parts of Jaw Crusher.
The size of the nip angle of the jaw crusher has a great influence on the property of the jaw crusher to crush ore.With the increase of the nip angle of the crushing machine,its crushing ratio will be increased while the productivity of the jaw crusher will be decreased.However,if the jaw crusher's nip angle is too big,it is probable that.Roll Crusher 911metallurgistThe sledging type of either single or double roll arrangement is usually differentiated by such titles as "roll crusher" or "sledging rolls." The only point of similarity in the actions of the crushing rolls and the gyratory and jaw types is that both do their crushing by pressure.
