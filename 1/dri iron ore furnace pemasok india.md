## EIA: India's steel industry dominated by electric based.
Although China and Japan produce more steel,India is the largest producer of DRI in the world.Direct reduced iron can be used in all major types of steel furnaces.Unlike direct reduced iron making facilities in other countries,which largely use natural gas,most of the direct reduced iron produced in India is powered by coal.Direct reduction of iron (DRI) 'Sponge iron'Direct reduction of iron (DRI) 'Sponge iron',another method of producing iron: All steelmaking processes require the input of iron bearing materials as process feedstock.For making steel in a basic oxygen furnace,the iron bearing feed materials are usually blast furnace hot metal and steel scrap.
