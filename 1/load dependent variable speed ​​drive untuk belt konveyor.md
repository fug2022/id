•Unit being transported retains its position (like a belt conveyor) •Orientation and placement of the load is controlled •Used for heavy loads or loads that might damage a belt •Bottling and canning plants use flat chain or slat conveyors because of wet conditions,temperature,and cleanliness requirementsVariable Frequency Drive TroubleshootingThe three phase voltage supplied by the PWM variable frequency drive,differently from a purely sinusoidal voltage,is not balanced.That is,owing to the variable frequency drive stage topology,the vector sum of the instantaneous voltages of the three phases at the variable frequency drive output does not cancel out,but results in a high frequency electric potential relative to a common.
