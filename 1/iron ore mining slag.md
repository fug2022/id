## Iron and Steel Slag Statistics and Information
In the production of iron,the blast furnace is charged with iron ore,fluxing agents,usually limestone and dolomite,and coke as fuel and the reducing agent.The iron ore is a mixture of iron oxides,silica,and alumina.From this and the added fluxing agents molten slag and iron are formed.Ancient iron production WikipediaAncient iron production refers to iron working in times from prehistory to the early Middle Ages where knowledge of production processes is derived from archaeological investigation.Slag,the byproduct of iron working processes such as smelting or smithing,is left at the iron working site rather than being moved away with the product.It also weathers well and hence it is readily available.
