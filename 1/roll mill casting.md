## Materials EVOLUTION OF KUBOTA TECHNOLOGY Kubota.
Child high alloy cast iron is used for the outer layer and high grade cast iron for the inner layer.This mill roll,which combined two different materials into one roll through centrifugal casting without separating them,achieved five times longer product life.At the World Foundry Congress in 1968,Kubota attracted the attention of each.Rolling (metalworking)Hot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material.After the grains deform during processing,they recrystallize,which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening.The starting material is usually large pieces of metal,like semi finished casting products,such as slabs,blooms,and billets.
