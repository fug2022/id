## Soft Constrained based MPC for Robust Control of a Cement.
In this paper,the soft MPC is tested in a real cement mill and compared with that of the existing high level controller based on the fuzzy logic principle.The main difference in controlling the cement mill in the CEMulator and the real plant is that the CEMulator has uncertainty and noise defined by IFAC DYCOPS 2013 December 18 20,2013.Effective Optimization of the Control System for the.Effective Optimization of the Control System for the Cement Raw Meal Mixing Process: I.PID Tuning Based on Loop Shaping.DIMITRIS TSAMATSOULIS.Halyps Building Materials S.A.Italcementi Group.
