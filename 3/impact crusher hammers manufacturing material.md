## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Impact Crushers Manufacturers,China Impact Crushers SuppliersThe hammer collided to form a crushing and was then thrown toward the counterattack plate to form an impact crusher again.As the material continued to descend,it was thrown repeatedly by the plate hammer to the first,second and third counterattack plates,forming multiple impact crushing in the counterattack cavity.
