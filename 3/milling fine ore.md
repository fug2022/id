## Milling Machine: Methods of Milling.Milling Processes
Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis.Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed,the overall removal is quite brisk.You might be.Ore Grinding Mills Mineral Processing & MetallurgyOre Grinding Mills are used for the fine grinding as the last step in the reduction of an ore prior to concentration (gravity or flotation) or cyanidation.Practice varies,depending upon the type of ore and the amount of reduction required.In addition,some of the older properties continue with methods that perhaps are not considered the best in light of recent improvements but that cannot be.
