## wet ball mill pdf
Ball Mill.Ball mill is the key equipment for grinding after the crushing process,which is widely used in the manufacture industries,such as cement,silicate,new building material,refractory material,fertilizer,ferrous metal,nonferrous metal and glass ceramics and can be used for the dry and wet grinding for all kinds of ores and other grind able materials.Low Cost Synthesis of Highly Luminescent Colloidal Lead.High energy ball milling is a type of mechanical grinding of materials.This process can be conducted in a dry (without solvents) or wet (with solvents) fashion.Laboratory scale ball milling (5−100 mL scale) is a batch process,whereas industrial ball mills can be operated in a continuous mode,thus oﬀering a very high synthesis throughput.
