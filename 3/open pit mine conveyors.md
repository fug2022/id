## Open pit mining Wikipedia
Open pit,open cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth,such as long wall mining.Open pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.Open pit mining ABBWith more than 1,000 large mining machines operating around the world,our equipment has proven to withstand the extreme conditions of open pit mining,from dusty and dirty environments,to severe vibrations,to temperatures ranging from 50° C to +50° C.Standard AC multi drive installations have been mechanically reinforced to make them.
