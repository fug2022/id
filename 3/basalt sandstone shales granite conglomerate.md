Igneous rocks are also called volcanic rocks and formed due to the cooling of melting magma.these are very strong rocks and examples include Granite,diorite,gabro,peridotite,obsidian,basalt,pumic,andisite,biodite.Sedimentary Rocks are fo.Metamorphic Rocks Earth Science Google SitesNote that a parent rock may metamorphose into several different metamorphic rocks.For example,shale (a sedimentary rock) can be transformed into slate,schist,or gneiss,depending on the degree of metamorphism.The greater the pressure or heat,the more likely the shale will change into gneiss.

## Conglomerate Sedimentary Rocks
Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock formed by the lithification of rounded or sub rounded gravel (grains larger than 2 mm in diameter).Conglomerate is strongly related to sandstone.It is actually a type of sandstone,although it may not be technically correct to say so.Why Does Basalt Weather Faster Than Granite? HunkerGranite,much lighter in color than basalt,contains high amounts of quartz.Quartz is a glas like mineral and very hard with no cleavage or weak spots.Orthoclase has 90.
