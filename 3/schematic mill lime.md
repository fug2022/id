## VSI mill Wikipedia
A VSI mill (vertical shaft impactor mill) is a mill that comminutes particles of material into smaller (finer) particles by throwing them against a hard surface inside the mill (called the wear plate).Any hard or friable materials can be ground with low value of metal waste.This type of mill is combined with a classifier for fine tuning of a product size.GoogleSearch the world's information,including webpages,images,videos and more.Google has many special features to help you find exactly what you're looking for.

## Mining uses of lime Carmeuse
In the mining industry,lime products are used to refine and condition metal ores and non ferrous metals such as Copper,Zinc,Nickel,Gold,Silver and Aluminum.For this application,lime products are used in the froth flotation of Copper,Nickel and Zinc and are used in Gold and Silver processing to ensure proper pH in the leaching circuit.Lime in Pulp and Paper Mills GraymontLime in Pulp and Paper Mills.Lime is used in several applications within pulp mills.One of the most common applications is for the sulfite pulping process.This process uses acid to dissolve the glue (lignin) that holds the fibers (cellulose) together.When acidic water discharged from this process is neutralized,lime is the reagent of.
