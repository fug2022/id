## What is the difference between a Cone Crusher and an.
Impact crushers crush by material impacting another object.Cone crushers use compression crushing where the material is crushed by being squeezed or compressed between two crushing surfaces.Selection of the type of crusher and the crushing process for any application depends on material hardness,and density of the material,feed size.Crushing technologyCone crushers are the choice for use in medium hard to hard and abrasive natural stone as well as for raw material preparation in mining applications.The cone crushers deliver cubic final grain sizes in the 2nd and 3rd crushing stage that meet the standards.The cone crushers are available in different sizes,versions and for various applications.

## REAL TIME OPTIMIZATION OF CONE CRUSHERS
models,software and hardware that enable real time optimization of a single crushing and screening stage.The main hypothesis is that fixed parameters can never be optimal over time because many things in the process vary continuously.The eccentric speed in a cone crusher determines the number of times a material isCrushing in Mineral ProcessingIn mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.
