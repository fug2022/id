## Suggested Compaction Standards for Crushed Aggregate.
density is adequate for each of the various materials making up the flexible pavement structure.It is with a solution to this problem,particularly as it applies to granular base and subbase materials,that this paper deals.There exists a wide variety of methods of laboratory tests for maximum density of soils and soil aggregate materials.Classification of AggregatesClassification of Aggregates.The variability in density can be used to produce concrete of widely different unit weights,see Table (1).The most common classification of aggregates on the basis of bulk specific gravity is lightweight,normal weight,and heavyweight aggregates.

## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals
Jan 23,2020 · The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore,these numbers translate directly to g cm 3,or tonnes per cubic meter (t m 3).Aggregates for Concretegate,such as gravel,requires slightly lower values,while crushed aggregate requires slightly higher values.Fine aggregate content is usually 35% to 45% by mass or volume of the total aggregate content.CHARACTERISTICS OF AGGREGATES.The important characteristics of aggregates for concrete are listed in Table 5 2 and most are discussed in.
