## Iron ore pricing explained Metal Bulletin.com
Iron ore is a non fungible commodity,and its quality varies.To help facilitate price adjustment for differences between expected and delivered product specifications,PRAs have developed value in use (VIU) indices for the key price affecting chemical components of iron ore iron.Production and Distribution of Iron Ore around the WorldThe main iron ore producing areas are located in Itabiria in south east Brazil.Itabiria is believed to be the richest iron ore reserves in the world estimated reserves of 35,000 million metric tons.Brazil's other important areas of iron ore are: Urucum (Mato Grosso),Catalao (Goias) and Ipanema (Sao Panto).

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information
Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).It almost always consists of iron oxides,the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3).Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.BENEFICIATION OF IRON ORE National Institute of.Major problem faced with the Indian iron ore is that though they are very rich in iron content they also have a high content of gangue material like silica and aluminium which obstruct the iron and steel production as the performance of the blast furnace lowers.Iron ore sample found is a part of banded iron ore formation.

## The Making of Iron & Steel SEAISI
Iron ore,as mined,is a combination of iron with oxygen and various other unwanted substances,generally known as "gangue".The first metallurgical step is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron,a process which is mostly carried out in a blast furnace,using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent.ProductionIron ore,one of the most abundant metals on Earth,is the primary raw material used to make steel.Operations We work in about 35 countries in mines,smelters and refineries,as well as in sales offices,data centres,research and development labs.
