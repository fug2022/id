## Weighing Screw Conveyor Belt scales & weigh feeder.
The product of rotation speed and net weight thus corresponds to the flow rate in kg or t per hour.It is important that the screw conveyor is completely uncoupled from the input and the output side.For this reason the weighing screw conveyor must be feed via a rotary valve or a second screw.Loss of Weight Batching Systems Weigh Batching and.As the conveyor unloads material at maximum feed rate,the load cells transmit loss of weight information to the controller which reduces the feed rate to dribble immediately prior to stopping the flexible screw conveyor or rotary airlock valve once the target batch weight has been discharged.System software permits mid batch bag changes.
