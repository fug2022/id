## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Ore Mining and Dressing Effluent Guidelines US EPACopper dressing relied extensively on manual labour throughout the 18th and 19th centuries,though mechanisation did play a part.Copper crushers ('Cornish rolls') were introduced in the early 19th century and low grade or otherwise difficult ores were also stamped at some mines.Copper ore was spalled in the same way as with tin.
