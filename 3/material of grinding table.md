## Abrasives How do abrasives work? Materials,Grinding.
Abrasion most frequently results from scratching a surface.As a general rule,a substance is only seriously scratched by a material that is harder than itself.This is the basis for the Mohs scale of hardness (see Table 2) in which materials are ranked according to their ability to scratch materials.GRINDING WHEEL and ABRASIVES BASICSGrinding wheel hardness.Hardness is rated from A Z with 'A' being the weakest bond and 'Z' being the strongest.A weak bond is preferred for grinding harder materials while a stronger bond is desired for softer materials.A typical weak bond for steel would be in the 'F,G or H' range.
