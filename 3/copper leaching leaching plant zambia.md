## Bwana Mkubwa Copper Plant Expansion Zambia Fluor EPC
Bwana Mkubwa was one of the world's lowest cost copper operations.The two phase expansion included conversion from a tailings leach to an ore tank leach operation.Fluor provided fast track services for engineering,procurement,construction support,and commissioning of the project.Agitated leach process the most cost effective for.The study demonstrated that the agitated leach route,followed by copper recovery using solvent extraction and electrowinning technology,is more economically viable than heap leaching for the.
