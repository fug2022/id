## Chromite: The only mineral ore of chromium metal
Chromite is important because it is the only economic ore of chromium,an essential element for a wide variety of metal,chemical,and manufactured products.Many other minerals contain chromium,but none of them are found in deposits that can be economically mined to produce chromium.Beneficiation WikipediaIn the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream ().Examples of beneficiation processes include froth flotation and gravity separation.Other economic uses of the term are in use.

## Mining and Beneficiation of Phosphate Ore IntechOpen
An alternative technique for the beneficiation of these ores is the calcination.Calcination is the process of heating the ore to a high temperature ranging from 800 to 1000°C to decompose CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 to CaO,MgO and gaseous CO 2.The CaO and MgO formed are then removed as hydroxides by quenching the calcined product in water and washing.Extraction and beneficiation methods of gold ores and.Extraction and beneficiation methods of gold ores and minerals.In gold ore processing equipment,there are a lot of beneficiation and extraction method of gold ore mine production line.For example,between heavy tinea leaching,extraction of amalgamation and so on and their mixing process,wherein the flotation method is an important separation means.
