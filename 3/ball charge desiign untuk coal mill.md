## Mill Charge an overview ScienceDirect Topics
In Mineral Processing Design and Operations (Second Edition),2016.9.3.4 Mill Speed.During normal operation the mill speed tends to vary with mill charge.According to available literature,the operating speeds of AG mills are much higher than conventional tumbling mills and are in the range of 80 85% of the critical speed.Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball millscement industry the ball mill was really an epoch making breakthrough as for almost 80 years it was the predominant mill for grinding of raw materials and coal,and still today is the most used mill for cement grinding.Over the last three decades the vertical roller mill has become the preferred mill.
