## Milling (machining) Wikipedia
The most advanced CNC milling machines,the multiaxis machine,add two more axes in addition to the three normal axes (XYZ).Horizontal milling machines also have a C or Q axis,allowing the horizontally mounted workpiece to be rotated,essentially allowing asymmetric and eccentric turning.The fifth axis (B axis) controls the tilt of the tool.2 vs.3 Axis Machining CNC Profiling CNC Machinist.Most CNC mills these days should be able to accept and perform programs with 3 axis machining.Two and three axis machines both have an X,Y,and Z axis,but using that third axis for milling profiles can allow you to profile the surface of a part.In 2 axis milling,you can move in the X and Y axis at the same time if you're milling the.

## CNC Machining: 3 Axis vs.5 Axis Indexed vs.5 Axis Continuous
Oct 11,2017 · Now 5 axis indexed milling isn't to be confused with true 5 axis machining,which allows for continuous machining of all three axes and the two rotational axes.Also known as 3+2 machining,5 axis indexed machining does not maintain continuous contact of the cutting tool and work piece through all rotational axes.Everything you need to know about 5 axis machiningWhen someone uses the term "5 axis" they are typically referring to the ability of a CNC machine to move a part or a tool on five different CNC axes at the same time.3 axis machining centers move a part in two directions (X and Y),and the tool moves up and down (Z).5 Axis machining centers can rotate on two additional rotary axes (A and B) which help the cutting tool approach the part.
