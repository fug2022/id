## Gravity separation Wikipedia
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components,either a suspension,or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e.the components of the mixture have different specific weight.All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.Heavy Media Gravity Separation Mine Engineer.ComHeavy Media Gravity Separation Heavy media gravity separation involves using a mixture of fine media material,such as magnetite (SG 5.1) or ferrosilicon (SG 6.8),suspended in a slurry of water,to produce a media slurry with a specific gravity that will allow low density material(s) to float,and other high density material(s) to sink.
