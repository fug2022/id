## ATTRITORS AND BALL MILLS HOW THEY WORK Robert E.
The theoretical critical speed of a ball mill is the speed at which the centrifugal force is sufficiently large to cause a small particle to adhere to the shell interior for a full revolution of the mill.The common range of mill speeds is 65% to 80% of critical,depending on mill type,size and the application.The Selection and Design of Mill Liners MillTrajFigure 5.High low wave ball mill liner Materials The selection of the material of construction is a function of the application,abrasivity of ore,size of mill,corrosion environment,size of balls,mill speed,etc.liner design and material of construction are integral and cannot be chosen in isolation.
