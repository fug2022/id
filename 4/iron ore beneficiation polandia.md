## Iron Ore Statistics and Information USGS
Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).It almost always consists of iron oxides,the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3).Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.Iron Ore Beneficiation Plant Manufacturers & Suppliers.the iron ore crushing plant and beneficiation plants are located at anantapur district,bordering bellary district of karnataka state of india.The land on which the plants are setup are taken on a long term lease.Iron ore processing,beneficiation,crushing and trading activities are.

## CURRENT PRACTICES IN INDIAN IRON ORE BENEFICIATION
Iron ore beneficiation facilities in the country are highly inadequate i.e.only 52 concentrators cater to the need for iron ore production of about 220 MTPA(mines 316).Of this around 50% of the.Iron ore pelletizing systems MetsoIron ore can be upgraded to a higher iron ore content through beneficiation.This process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process.Also during the processing of high grade iron ores which don't need beneficiated,fines which are generated can be pelletized and used instead of being.
