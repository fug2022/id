## Milling Positive Master for Polydimethylsiloxane.
Sep 21,2017 · Compared with the fabrication of patterns in negative masters via mechanical milling,that of a positive master uses only one end mill to complete,and only a single molding step which is simpler and results in reduce time for the construction of PDMS microdevices.Characteristics and mechanism of top burr. ScienceDirectThe schematic drawing of microchannel slotting by arrayed thin slotting cutters is shown in Fig.1 where v c is the cutting speed,v f is the feed speed,a p and w are cutting depth and width respectively.The up milling method was chosen in the experiments because chips stick to the mircochannels easily during the down milling process.
