## Confused about "acid test" for silver and other precious.
Confused about "acid test" for silver and other precious metals.A discussion started in 2001 but continuing through 2019.Aqua regia is a mixture of 75% Nitric and 25% Hydrochloric (Muriatic) acid,as correctly pointed by Chemical Engineer.I rubbed one of my wife's rings on my gold testing stone and then pulled a drop of the testing.Hydrochloric acid GoldRefiningWiki(Main article : Dissolving gold with hydrochloric acid and bleach) An alternative to aqua regia is to use hydrochloric acid and bleach,the bleach breaks down in the acidic mixture and gives off chlorine gas.This has the power to dissolve gold but not as fast as aqua regia.Often used on gold foils or powders.Hydrochloric acid and hydrogen.

## Fun Things to do with hydrochloric acid Naked Science Forum
Sep 04,2011 · So I was searching around the house for things to do and i came across a nice big bottle of 45% hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid on the bottle) held it at arms length when opening and within a couple seconds i was able to smell that it is still very much acid,poured a little into an old glass and put a pH indicator strip,came back in a minute and it ate the indicator right off the strip.How To Decrease pH using Muriatic Acid Par Pool & Spa*Note: Do not add more than 1 quart of acid per 10,000 gallons of water at one time.If the pool requires more than 1 Quart of Muriatic Acid per 10,000 gallons of water,add the maximum amount then retest 12 24 hours later and make further adjustments.

## Difference Between Muriatic Acid and Hydrochloric Acid.
Apr 01,2015 · Hydrochloric acid can be produced in random purities depending on the purpose they are used for.When it is produced as a chemical reagent,it is very pure and called is called hydrochloric acid.Muriatic acid is produced by distilling acid and salt.The purity of muriatic acid is less compared to original hydrochloric acid.Dissolving Gold and Precipitating Gold Pyrometallurgy.Mixing muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) with bleach (sodium hypochlorite),you are freeing chlorine to attack the gold.You are making gold chloride.Try exposing the solution to ultraviolet light,to break the bond between the gold and the chlorine molecules.

## Aqua regia Wikipedia
The reaction with hydrochloric acid is an equilibrium reaction that favors formation of chloroaurate anions (AuCl 4 −).This results in a removal of gold ions from solution and allows further oxidation of gold to take place.The gold dissolves to become chloroauric acid.In addition,gold may be dissolved by the chlorine present in aqua regia.MURIATIC ACIDMURIATIC ACID Material Safety Data Sheet Emergency 24 Hour Telephone: CHEMTREC 800.424.9300 Corporate Headquarters: Hasa Inc.23119 Drayton Street Saugus,California 91350 Telephone 661.259.5848 Fax 661.259.1538 IDENTIFICATION OF PRODUCT Product Name: HASA MURIATIC ACID Common Chemical Names: 31.45% Hydrochloric Acid,HCl
