## Precious Metal Heap Leach Design and Practice
Precious Metal Heap Leach Design and Practice Daniel W.Kappes1 ABSTRACT Heap leaching of gold and silver ores is conducted at approximately 120 mines worldwide.Heap leaching is one of several alternative process methods for treating precious metal ores,and is selected primarily to take advantage of its low capital cost relative to other methods.Heap Leaching,Heap Leaching Consulting,Heap Leaching of.Heap leaching (HL) is a flexible and economic mineral processing method,commonly used to extract gold from low grade gold ores.In this process,ore is firstly crushed to fine particles.By spraying leaching solution to the large piles,the gold containing solution is leached.

## Agglomeration technique improves heap leaching process.
Where only around 3 percent of copper and gold was extracted through heap leaching decades ago,more than 30 percent of copper and gold are now produced courtesy of this hydrometallurgical technique.2 Unfortunately,one challenge can stand in the way of a viable heap leaching operation: poor heap permeability.Cyanide Use in Gold Mining EarthworksHeap leaching: In the open,cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads.The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.The pad collects the now metal impregnated solution which is stripped of gold and resprayed on the heap until the ore is depleted.
