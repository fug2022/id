## MINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF LIMONITE AS A WEATHERING.
mineralogy and geochemistry of limonite as a weathering product of ilvaite in the yeshan iron deposit,tongling,chinagoethite in iron oreGoethite is an iron oxide hydroxide although manganese can substitute for up to 5 percent of the iron It forms as a weathering product in the oxidation zones of veins of iron minerals such as pyrite magnetite and siderite Goethite may occur with these minerals in the gossan or iron hat which is the weathered capping of an iron ore deposit.

## Morphological varieties of goethite in iron ores from.
Goethite is one of the most common minerals and is typically formed under oxidising conditions as a weathering product of iron bearing minerals (Klein and Hurlbut,1985).It has a multitude of shapes and sizes but occurs commonly with a basic acicular morphology (Cornell and Schwertmann,1996).These needle like crystals can range in size and.Goethite WikipediaGoethite is an iron oxyhydroxide containing ferric iron.It is the main component of rust and bog iron ore.Goethite's hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale,and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3.The mineral forms prismatic needle like crystals ("needle iron ore") but is.

## Genesis of lateritic iron ore from banded iron formation.
Lateritic weathering of metamorphosed Proterozoic banded iron formation (BIF),locally named itabirite in Brazil,produced large deposits of iron ore.At the Capanema iron ore mine in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero in Minas Gerais state (southeast Brazil),the BIF is a bedded metasedimentary rock composed essentially of layers of hematite kenomagnetite alternating with layers of quartz.Iron Hematite Magnetite And Goethite Aluneth Heavy MachineryGoethite is normally formed under oxidizing conditions as a weathering product of iron minerals eg pyrite magnetite Because it is formed near the surface goethite is the major component of the gossan of iron sulfide deposits in locations such as Arizona and of lateritic deposits in places such as Cuba.Learn More magnetite vs limonite.what is.

## pyrite Properties & Facts Britannica
Historically,pyrite was used commercially as a source of sulfur,particularly for the production of sulfuric acid,but today sulfur is largely collected as a by product of petroleum processing.Because of the availability of much better sources of iron,pyrite is not generally used as an iron ore.Limonite WikipediaWhile the first iron ore was likely meteoric iron,and hematite was far easier to smelt,in Africa,where the first evidence of iron metallurgy occurs,limonite is the most prevalent iron ore.Before smelting,as the ore was heated and the water driven off,more and more of the limonite was converted to hematite.
