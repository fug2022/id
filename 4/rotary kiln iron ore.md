## Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) International Iron Metallics.
In India there are many small rotary kiln furnaces producing DRI,known locally as sponge iron,using coal as energy and reductant source.Some of the sponge iron plants are captive to steel mills,but there is a significant domestic merchant market,India producing 57% of.Modelling and optimization of a rotary kiln direct.The kiln model applied in this work was developed by Hatch over a number of years and has been used for several rotary kiln projects.It has its roots in a FORTRAN program that was developed by Venkateswaran (1978) to study the reduction of iron ore.The original software was used to model the operation of a 35 m pilot kiln at the Stellco company

Iron ore green balls are soft and easy to break.So after the pelletizing and screening operations,iron ore pellets have to be hardened in a furnace through a firing process.Once fired,they can be handled,loaded in ships or trains and delivered to the end users.OrePro Microwave Iron Pellet Technology> Who We Are.Ore Pro Microwave Technology Breakthrough.Ore Pro has conducted both primary and secondary research into the Magnetite Pellet Iron Ore Industry and has developed a microwave pellet kiln technology that serves to create a new set of opportunities within the iron pellet business as we currently know it.

## KOBELCO Pelletizing Process
Iron ore must be shipped in bulk for maximum economy.1.2 Pretreatment process In this process,the iron ore is ground into fines having qualities required for the subsequent balling process.The pretreatment includes concentrating,dewatering,grinding,drying and prewetting.In general,low grade iron ore is ground into finesIBU tec The Rotary Kiln Experts for Trials and ProductionRotary kilns (sometimes called calciners or rotary furnaces) are used for thermal treatment processes such as calcination,sintering,pyrolysis and firing,as well as for oxidation and reduction.These treatments can be applied to powders,granulates,suspensions and green bodies.A rotary kiln consists of a cylindrical,rotating body mounted between stationary material feed and outlet housings.

## Rikard Edland Chalmers Publication Library (CPL)
The production of iron ore pellets,which is vital to the production of steel,is expected to be an important industry for many years to come.The pelletizing of iron ore is often performed in the 'Grate Kiln' process,in which the iron ore is heated,first on a traveling grate and then in a rotary kiln.Deposit Formation in a Grate Kiln Plant for Iron Ore.Slag formation in the grate kiln process is a major problem for iron ore pellet producers.It is therefore important to understand the slag formation mechanism in the grate kiln production plant.This study initiated the investigation by in situ sampling and identifying particles in the flue gas from a full scale 40 MW grate kiln production plant for iron ore pelletizing.
