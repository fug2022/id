## NATURAL AND CALCINED CLAYEY DIATOMITE AS CEMENT.
Diatomite is a highly porous silica rich material mainly composed of diatom shells.Even though the shells are porous themselves,the remarkably high porosity of diatomite is due to the open spaces present between the diatom shells composing the rock.The porous structure of diatomite makes it a poor conductor of heat and a good insulator.What is Diatomite? Industrial Minerals Association.The properties which make diatomite valuable include low density,high porosity,high surface area,abrasiveness,insulating properties,inertness,absorptive capacity,brightness,and high silica content.Diatomite has a wide variety of uses,and is a component in hundreds of products,or vital to the manufacturing process of thousands more.
