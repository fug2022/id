## Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe®
Ball mill operation is often regarded as something of a mystery for several reasons.Ball milling is not an art it's just physics.The first problem will ball mills is that we cannot see what is occurring in the mill.The other problem is that many of the independent variables.Optimization of mill performance by usingto the volumetric mill filling which influences grinding media wear rates,throughput,power draw,and product grind size from the circuit.Each of these performance parameters peaks at different filling values.In order to contin uously optimize mill operation,it is vital to obtain regular measurements of the ball load and pulp position.
