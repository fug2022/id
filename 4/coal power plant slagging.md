## New methods to reduce risk of boiler slagging
of boiler slagging Worldwide,boiler slagging is the most common coal quality related cause of power plant availability losses.Our work with this plant has led to a greater understanding of the issue and the development of new risk assessment calculations to support all coal fired plants in.Mapped: The world's coal power plants in 2019And there are now 78 countries using coal power,up from 66 in 2000.Another 16 plan to join the club,notably Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.CO2 emissions from existing plants are enough to breach the carbon budget for 1.5 or 2C.These limits would mean no new coal plants and closing 20% of the fleet early,according to one recent study.
