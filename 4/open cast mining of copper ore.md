## The Advantages of Open Pit Mining Sciencing
Mar 13,2018 · Open pit mining does offer some advantages over traditional deep shaft mining.Pit mining is more cost effective than shaft mining because more ore can be extracted and more quickly.The working conditions are safer for the miners because there is no risk of cave in or toxic gas.Open pit mining is the preferred.Open Pit Mining MethodsOpen pit mining methods are applicable to mining ore deposits that apex at or near the surface.If the deposit apexes below the surface,the overburden and barren capping overlying the ore must be removed in advance of open pit mining.The removal of this material is known as stripping.

## Open Pit Mining Techniques Surface Mines Rock or Mineral.
Open pit mines are characteristically engorged until either the mineral resource is exhausted,or a mounting ratio of overburden to ore makes more mining uneconomic.When this occurs,the exhausted mines are at times converted to landfills for disposal of solid wastes.KOV Open Pit Mine Katanga Mining LimitedThe KOV mine is the largest high grade copper resource in the world.It comprises four ore bodies,Kamoto East,Oliveira,Virgule and FNSR,accessed via two pits,Kamoto East and KOV.The Kamoto East pit was operational from 1960 to 1985 and the adjacent.
