on complexity.Approximately 9M and 120M is expended on the comminution circuit (crushing,stockpiling and grinding) representing 35% and 50% of plant capital cost for the 1 Mt a and 20 Mt a plants,respectively.Comminution costs include power,grinding media and maintenance materials.Top Five Grinding and milling technics for Graphite.Jan 24,2012 · Graphite Graphite is a dark gray to black mineral with a metallic luster,it has relatively low hardness(0.5 1 in Mohs).However,because of graphite's often occurrence as flakes and the covalent bonds strength within the sheet like graphene,it is very hard to grind graphite to fine particle size.For sizes above 100 microns,most hammer.
