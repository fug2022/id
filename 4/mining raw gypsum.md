## How drywall is made material,manufacture,making,used.
Raw Materials The primary component of drywall is the mineral gypsum.It is a light density rock found in plentiful deposits worldwide.Each molecule of gypsum (or dihydrous calcium sulfate) is composed of two molecules of water (H 2 0) and one of calcium sulfate (CaSO 4 ).By weight the compound is 21% water,but by volume it is nearly 50% water.Gypsum WikipediaGypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate,with the chemical formula CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O.It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster,blackboard sidewalk chalk,and drywall.

## Synthetic Gypsum an overview ScienceDirect Topics
FGD issues affect,directly or indirectly,coal,gypsum,lime,limestone,and soda ash industries.Increased commercial use of FGD products represents an economic opportunity for high sulfur coal producers and the sorbent industry.Synthetic gypsum competes directly with natural gypsum as raw material for wallboard and cement manufacture.British Gypsum: Brightling gypsum mineThe British Gypsum Brightling mine,near the Robertsbridge wallboard plant in East Sussex,has been in operation since the early 1960s.In the 1970s and 1980s it supplied up to 0.8Mt yr of gypsum to the Robertsbridge wallboard plant,first via an aerial ropeway system and then a 4.7km long conveyor,which was installed in 1989.

## Why Is Gypsum Added to Cement? Hunker
Gypsum is a naturally occurring mineral mined from deposits formed by ancient seabeds as a raw material.Composed of calcium sulfate and water,it is used for a variety of manufacturing,industrial,and agricultural uses.An important property of gypsum is that it is naturally fire resistant.
