Asphalt milling will remove the top layer of an asphalt surface that has taken on cracks,raveling,or other damage.The old layer that has sustained damage must be removed to ensure an even bond when the new asphalt is applied,and to maintain a level surface.An asphalt milling machine will grind down 1″ to 3″ depending on the wear of the.Existing Surface Preparation for Overlays Pavement.Video 1.Milling machine.After a pavement has been milled the resulting surface is quite dirty and dusty.The surface should be cleaned off by sweeping or washing before any overlay is placed otherwise the dirt and dust will decrease the bond between the new overlay and the existing pavement (Figure 10 and 11).
