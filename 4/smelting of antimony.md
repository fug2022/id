## 12.3 Primary Copper Smelting
A typical pyrometallurgical copper smelting process,as illustrated in Figure 12.3 1,includes 4 steps: roasting,smelting,concentrating,and fire refining.Ore concentration is roasted to reduce impurities,including sulfur,antimony,arsenic,and lead.The roasted product,calcine,serves as a dried and heated charge for the smelting furnace.Palladium Refining Complete Process Part 1of2Apr 17,2018 · This feature is not available right now.Please try again later.

## Extraction of Antimony Element Antimony,Sb,Metalloid
Antimony is extracted mainly from ores containing antimony trisulphide in the form of stibnite.Rich ores are first subjected to liquation,whereby the fusible sulphide is removed from the gangue and concentrated.The concentrate is then reduced to metal by smelting with wrought iron in pots,in reverberatory furnaces or sometimes in blast.The exposure to and health effects of antimonyLong term exposure to antimony in smelting plants may result in the formation of antimoniosis,a particular form of pneumoconiosis.Chronic exposure will potentiate lung,heart,and gastrointestinal diseases.The effects on health are inducement of vomiting and eye and mucous membrane irritation.Stibine is a hemolytic agent.

## How to Remove Arsenic,Antimony & Bismuth from Copper
Removal of arsenic,antimony and bismuth from copper may take place in the smelting operations by scorification,volatilization,or,under special treatment,by processes of concentration.Owing to the great variety of materials that are treated in economical metallurgy,it is rarely possible to obtain exact weights from any particular operation.ANTIMONYproduce antimony as a by product of smelting lead and other metals.Antimony isn't used alone because it breaks easily,but when mixed into alloys,it is used in lead storage batteries,solder,sheet and pipe metal,bearings,castings,and pewter.Antimony oxide is added to textiles and plastics to prevent them from catching fire.
