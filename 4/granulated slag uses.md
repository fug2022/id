## Blast Furnace Slag National Slag Association
Blast furnace slag is allowed to slowly cool by ambient air,is processed through a screening and crushing plant and is processed into many sizes for use primarily as a construction aggregate.Common uses are as aggregates in ready mix concrete,precast concrete,hot mix asphalt aggregate,septic drain fields and pipe backfill.GBFS Cement ScienceAfter the granulated blast furnace slag is formed,it must be dewatered,dried and ground,using processes similar to those used with Portland cement clinker to make Portland cement.Typically,granulated slag is ground to an air permeability (blaine) fineness exceeding that of Portland cement to obtain increased hydraulic activity at early ages.

## MSDS: Slag Material Safety Data Sheet
Product Use: Slag is used as a supplementary cementitious material for cement,concrete and concrete products.It is also used in soil stabilization and as filler in asphalt and other products that are widely used in construction.Note: This MSDS covers many types of slag.Individual composition of hazardous constituents will vary between slag.Effects of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag in.2001 by slag cement manufacturers and the Slag Cement Association,the American Concrete Institute officially reviewed and changed the terminology from GGBFS to slag cement (ACI Committee 233,2004).The term slag cement will be used throughout this paper when referring to finely ground granulated blast furnace slag.

## Granulated Blast Furnace Slag,Ground Granulated Blast.
Granulated Blast Furnace Slag.Granulated Blast Furnace Slag is the residue of combustion in the furnace of the steel refining process or byproducts of the steel plant such as PT Krakatau Steel (Persero) Tbk.and its subsidiary PT Krakatau Posco."Ground Granulated Blast Slag (GGBS) In Concrete A Review"Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag (GGBS)[1] is a by product from the blast furnaces used to make iron.These operate at a temperature of about 1500 degrees centigrade and are fed with a carefully controlled mixture of iron ore,coke and limestone.The iron ore is reduced to iron and the remaining materials from a slag

## Processing of Granulated Blast Furnace Slag and its.
The efficiency,which the molten blast furnace slag is rapidly chilled,as well as the chemical composition of the slag source,largely determines its cementitious properties for use in concrete.After the granulated blast furnace slag is formed,it must be dewatered,dried and ground,using processes similar to those used with Portland cement.Slag Cement QuestionsSlag cement use can be traced to the 1700's when the material was combined with lime to make mortars.The first United States production was in 1896.Until the 1950's,granulated slag was used in the manufacture of blended portland cements,or as raw feedstock to make cement clinker.
