Kaolinite is a clay mineral,with a soft consistency and earthy texture.It is easily broken and can be molded or shaped,especially when wet.Kaolinite is a lackluster and uninteresting mineral on its own,but it occasionally forms interesting pseudomorphs,especially after feldspars.It is also a common accessory to other minerals,including gem crystals in decomposing feldspar pegmatites.Technofile: Geology for Potters Ceramic Arts NetworkSep 28,2015 · Alumina (Al 2 O 3): The main source of alumina is clay,usually in the form of kaolin,ball clay,or bentonite.It can also be found in its pure form in alumina hydrate and is present in feldspar and kyanite,a metamorphic rock composed of alumina and silica and used as grog in clay.
