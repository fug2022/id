## Railroad Ballast Southern Crushed Concrete
Product Description.Railroad Ballast is a recycled product commonly made up of crushed limestone or other rock.It is primarily used during the construction and maintenance of railroads,holding the wooden cross ties in place and in turn,holding the rails in place.Michael's Model Railways: Ballast and gravelThe ballast is fine granite no idea of the source as I've had a big bag for years! This is placed with a brush to fit between but not on the sleepers tapping the rail sometimes helps shake the granite off the sleepers.I then mist it with a fine water spray,then drop dilute PVA (with a drop of washing up liquid in) over it using a dropper.

## Track ballast Wikipedia
Track ballast should never be laid down less than 150 mm (6 inches) thick,and high speed railway lines may require ballast up to 0.5 metres (20 inches) thick.An insufficient depth of ballast causes overloading of the underlying soil,and in unfavourable conditions,overloading the soil causes the track to sink,usually unevenly.NEOBALLAST: new high performance and long lasting ballast.and recycled aggregates.The technical upgrades of this new ballast aggregate involves reducing the stiffness of the track (ratio of the load applied to the rail to vertical rail deflection),high abrasion resistance (i.e.less fines) and more energy dissipated through contact with the rubber coating.
