## Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC) Limestone
Specialty Minerals' ECO CAL® AG is a calcium carbonate co product generated during the crushing and screening process of calcite ore mined in Adams,MA.ECO CAL® AG,commonly referred to as AG lime,is a cost effective source of calcium for soil conditioning and animal nutrition.Precipitated Calcium Carbonate from Limestone Chemical.Jun 01,2016 · Initially,the limestone from a quarry is stored in bins.Typical extracted limestone contains about 75 wt.% of CaCO3.Mined limestone is crushed in a jaw crusher and calcined (burned) in a vertical shaft lime kiln at about 1,000°C.In the kiln,the calcium carbonate present in the limestone decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO;.

## Limestone,pH and calcium Progressive Forage
One of the most common points of confusion concerns limestone,pH and calcium.Many think these refer to the same thing.There is a big difference in pH and calcium,as well as limestone and limestone sources.Knowing the difference can mean big yield and quality increases in your forages.LimestoneThe principal mineral of limestone is calcite (CaCO3),a form of calcium carbonate.Limestone is composed of material derived by both chemical and biological activities.Often,little distinction is made between limestone and dolostone because they are often interchangeable in their uses.Both are frequently sold under the name of limestone.
