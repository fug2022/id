## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatiGrinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process ControlGrinding in ball mills is an important technological process applied to reduce the size of particles which may have different nature and a wide diversity of physical,mechanical and chemical characteristics.Typical examples are the various ores,minerals,limestone,etc.The applications of ball mills are ubiquitous in mineral

The mill (with 30 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length) and the test conditions are standardized,with a maximum ball size of 40 mm and an ore top size of 3.35 mm.With less than 300 balls,it poses no challenge in running the simulations,if only grinding media are included.For such a small mill,one could also include the ore or powder charge.Ball Mill Design Power CalculationThe basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum 'chunk size',product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open closed.

## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case".Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.Page 1 Ball Milling Theory freeshellinvolve grinding).With Lloyd's ball milling book having sold over 2000 copies,there are probably over 1000 home built ball mills operating in just America alone.This article borrows from Lloyd's research,which was obtained from the commercial ball milling industry,and explains some of the key design criteria for making your own ball mill.

and with the decreased grain size,the necessary ball size also decreases (Olejnik,2010; 2011).For each grain size there is an optimal ball size (Trumic et.al.2007).The bigger ball in relation to the optimal one will have an excess energy,and consequently,the smaller ball mill has less energy necessary for grinding.In bothComputer Simulation of Product Size Distribution of awhere x&#39 is a size such that a very significant portion of the product which is less than this size was produced by fine breakage.In the calculation,this
