## Querying Pivotal GemFire Docs
GemFire provides a SQL like querying language called OQL that allows you to access data stored in GemFire regions.Since GemFire regions are key value stores where values can range from simple byte arrays to complex nested objects,GemFire uses a query syntax based on OQL (Object Query Language) to query region data.Working with Indexes Geode DocsAn index can provide significant performance gains for query execution.A query run without the aid of an index iterates through every object in the collection.If an index is available that matches part or all of the query specification,the query iterates only over the indexed set,and query processing time can be.

Jun 26,2008 · A content delivery network (CDN) typically includes a mapping system for directing requests to CDN servers.One or more peer machines become associated with the CDN,and the CDN mapping system is then used to enable a given peer to locate another peer in the P2P network.Complex Queries in Peer to peer Systemsfor IR we can use P2P networks which are basically overlay nets and easy to change.After all,internet was also originally an overlay on the telephone network.1.1 Applications A peer to peer (or P2P) network is based on the concept of pooling resources of the participants in the network,eliminating the distinction between servers and clients.
