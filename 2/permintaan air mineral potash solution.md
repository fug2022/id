## Potash Wikipedia
The term potash comes from the Middle Dutch word potaschen (pot ashes,1477).The old method of making potassium carbonate (K 2 CO 3) was by collecting or producing wood ash (an occupation carried out by ash burners),leaching the ashes and then evaporating the resulting solution in large iron pots,leaving a white residue called pot ash.Potash an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe discovery of mineral potassium chloride at Stassfurt,Germany,in 1852,rapidly provided competition to the wood ash leachate industry since this mineral could be readily converted to potassium carbonate by the Leblanc process,which was already in commercial scale operation (see Chap.7).The mineral potash is also more specifically.
