## Black sand Wikipedia
Black sand is sand that is black in color.One type of black sand is a heavy,glossy,partly magnetic mixture of usually fine sands,found as part of a placer deposit.Another type of black sand,found on beaches near a volcano,consists of tiny fragments of basalt.While some beaches are predominantly made of black sand,even other color beaches (e.g.gold and white) can often have deposits.How to Remove the Flour Gold From Black Sand Our PastimesBlack sand deposits,which are composed of heavy metal materials such as iron and hematite,are common in areas where gold is found.While mining hobbyists typically regard the presence of black sand as an indicator of gold deposits,the sands themselves contain small particles of gold,called flour gold,and the sands are frequently processed for gold extraction.
