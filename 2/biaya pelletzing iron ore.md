## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years,owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries.However,the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low grade iron ore has been processed.The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.This chapter shows the status of the pelletizing process.The Iron Pelletizing Process: Part One :: Total Materia.The most commonly employed agglomeration technique is pelletizing by which a mixture of iron ore,water,and binder is rolled up in a mechanical disc or drum to produce agglomerates (green or wet pellets).Figure 1: Iron pellets.The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub processes,or process segments.
