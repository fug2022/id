The mine tour is the main attraction,an hour long ride around the open pit mine with stops at an overlook and a tour inside a refining building.There is some informative patter from the guide,but mostly it's a chance to observe the immense scale of an open pit mine and the complexity of getting minerals out of the ground.IMAGE GALLERY: How to build an underground copper mine.An open pit mine,which is currently in the feasibility stage,is planned to be built nearby.Nevada Copper's president and CEO is Matt Gili,a mining engineer with a focus on underground operations.A feasibility study for the open pit is starting this year.floatation and thickening circuit; and filtering circuit.Anticipated.

## Tailings.info In pit tailings storage
In pit tailings storage,as the name suggests,is simply the process of backfilling abandoned open pit surface mines with tailings (figure 1).This method is very attractive to a mine operator as worked out voids can be filled at a fraction of the costs associated with designing,constructing and operating a conventional,thickened,paste or.Paper: Thickener performance variability: underflow solids.The statistical analysis of actual recorded data of underflow solids concentration and flowrate of different thickeners is presented in this paper.The collected data are from the operation of four different mines; one Zinc lead,two Copper and one Gold mine.

## Open pit mining Wikipedia
Open pit mining is to be considered one of the most dangerous sectors in the industrial world.It causes significant effects to miners health,as well as damage to the ecological land.Open pit mining causes changes to vegetation,soil,and bedrock,which ultimately contributes to changes in surface hydrology,groundwater levels,and flow paths.[PHOTOS] Top 10 Largest Open Pit Mines in the World Top.Located in the vast landscape of the Atacama Desert in Chile,the Escondida Copper Mine is one of the largest open pit mines in the world.Consisting of two open mines Escondida Pit and Escondida Norta the mine is 3.9 kilometer long,2.7 kilometers wide and 645 meters deep.The mine ranks as the third deepest open pit operation.

## Paper: An Integrated Approach to Paste Thickening and.
Abstract: During April 2008,De Beers commissioned a new diamond mine near Kroonstad South Africa,known as Voorspoed Mine.Water scarcity in the area required the use of paste thickeners at the end of the process to recover as much water as possible.An integrated approach was used to design the paste thickeners and slurry pipeline system that was needed to deliver as high a solids.Back Forty Mine Project Aquila Resources OperationsOpen pit mining is practical when orebodies are located closer to the surface.The open pit will have stepped sides,called benches,to ensure the safety of the miners and a wide ramp where equipment can travel,allowing the product to be removed efficiently from the mine to the mill located three quarters of a mile east of the open pit.
