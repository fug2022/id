## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining Education.
The noise,dust,and impact from explosions can result in noise pollution and dust.Underground forces from the blasts can cause sinkholes or change the drainage and water quality of underground aquifers.Construction equipment,such as large trucks,crushing machines and earth moving equipment,also contribute to noise and dust.A Review on the Influence of Rock Quarry Dust on.Aug 11,2016 · Past studies clearly indicate that the quarry dust has a beneficial effect on different geotechnical properties of soil.Therefore,the present study attempts to review the findings reported in the literature to reveal the influence of quarry dust on different geotechnical properties of soil.

## Effect of Fly Ash on Mortar Mixes with Quarry Dust as Fine.
Abstract.This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation carried out to evaluate the compressive strength and transverse strength of 1 : 3 mortar mixes in which natural sand was replaced with 20%,50%,and 100% quarry dust by weight which were further modified by partially replacing cement with four percentages (15%,20%,25%,and 30%) of low calcium fly ash.A Study on Strength of Concrete With Partial Replacement.The present paper deals with partial replacement of cement with quarry dust and metakaolin which are having silica used as admixture for making concrete.First quarry dust is made partial replacement of cement and found that 25% of partial replacement is beneficial to concrete without loss of standard strength of cement.
