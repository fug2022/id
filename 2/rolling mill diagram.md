## Rolling Mill Cooling Bed IspatGuru
Jun 22,2019 · Cooling bed is very crucial to the process of rolling in a rolling mill since it is to carefully transfer and cool the hot rolled steel bar after the rolling process.As this is an integral part of a rolling mill,any mechanical problem or failure to the cooling bed has a huge consequence for the rolling mill.Rolling processes Al Mustansiriya UniversityRolling processes 5 1 introduction: Rolling is the process of reducing the thickness or changing the cross section of a long workpiece by compressive forces applied through a set of rolls,as shown in figure (5 1).Fig.(5 1) Most rolling is carried out by hot working,called hot rolling,owing to the large amount of deformation required.
