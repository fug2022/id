## Geology of Gold Mineralization & How Gold Deposits are Formed
From these data,estimates can be made of the deposit's value.One of the most commonly used methods for determining the gold and silver content of mineralized rocks is the fire assay.The results are reported as troy ounces of gold or silver or both per short avoirdupois ton of ore or as grams per metric ton of ore.Galena WikipediaGalena is the main ore of lead,used since ancient times.Because of its somewhat low melting point,it was easy to liberate by smelting.It typically forms in low temperature sedimentary deposits.In some deposits the galena contains about 1 2% silver,a byproduct that far outweighs the main lead ore in revenue.In these deposits significant amounts of silver occur as included silver sulfide.
