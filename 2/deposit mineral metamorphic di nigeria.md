## Economic Geology (111201491) Part4: Metamorphic Ore.
Metamorphic Ore deposits Several kinds of nonmetallic mineral deposits are formed as a result of regional metamorphism.The source materials are rock constitutions that have undergone recrystallization or re combination,or both.The enclosing rocks are wholly or in part metamorphosed; it is the rock metamorphism that has given rise to the.Some metallogenetic features of the Nigerian basement.It is suggested that Nigeria's relatively low metal production from basement deposits is attributable to a regional low metallogenetic inheritance which in turn has discouraged intensive prospecting but there is good potential especially for industrial mineral deposits.

## potential mineral deposits in imo state nigeria
Mineralogical and Physicochemical Assessment of,The physicochemical characterization of coal samples from deposits provides mineral distribution and composition data for utilization by scientists and policy makers The characterization of coal samples of Ihioma coal deposits in Imo state,Nigeria was performed using proximate and ultimate.Deformation,metamorphism,and mobilization of Ni Cu PGE.Abstract.The Garson Ni Cu platinum group element deposit is a deformed,overturned,low Ni tenor contact type deposit along the contact between the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC) and stratigraphically underlying rocks of the Huronian Supergroup in the South Range of the 1.85 Ga Sudbury structure.

## Uranium — Where Is It Found? New Mexico Bureau of.
Uranium can be found in soils and waters due to the breakdown (weathering) of rocks containing it.Once it is in the soil and water,it can be taken up by plants and consumed by people or grazing animals,or it can dissolve in the water to be consumed by any organism.Minerals and Africa's Developmentvi MINERALS AND AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT!e International Study Group Report on Africa's Mineral Regimes.Main mineral deposits of Africa 184 Appendix F: U.S.Mineral Materials Ranked by Net Import Reliance 2010 186.THE DEVELOPMENT OF mineral resources can have very di&erent implications,and consequences,for com munities,governments.

Jun 23,2010 · Stanton concludes that it would be going too far to maintain that there was no such thing as a regional metamorphic mineral reaction,or that regional metamorphic equilibrium was never attained,but the role of metamorphic reactions in generating the bulk of regional metamorphic mineral matter is "probably,quite contrary to present belief.USGS Mineral Resources On Line Spatial DataMRDS describes metallic and nonmetallic mineral resources throughout the world.Included are deposit name,location,commodity,and references.Some records include deposit description,geologic characteristics,production,reserves,and resources.It includes the original MRDS and MAS MILS data.
