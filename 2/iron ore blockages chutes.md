## Transfer Chute Upgrade Increases Throughput,Eliminates.
A major iron ore processing facility in Western Australia was embarking on a de bottlenecking project at one of their biggest ports and was seeking to improve transfer chute functions to increase tonnages and throughput,while increasing belt availability.Enhanced Technology for Blocked Chute Detection E & MJInstalling point detection devices in transfer chutes for blockage detection is necessary as it is an inexpensive way of pre empting a chute blockage.These transfer chutes are everywhere at mining sites,and one plugged chute can stop production.Screens,both wet and sizing,are also key to the smooth operation of a facility,and they are.
