## ABB knows the most common bearing difﬁ culties and how.
groove ball bearings are the most common type of bear ing,and can handle both radial and thrust loads.Due to their low frictional torque,they are suitable for high speeds.In a ball bearing,the load is transmitted from the outer race to the ball and from the ball to the inner race.Since the ball is a sphere,it only contacts the inner and
